<li>1/4 cup (2 fl oz) olive oil</li>
<li>2 yellow onions, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups/6 oz)</li>
<li>4 small carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch dice (about 1 cup/5 oz)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons chopped garlic</li>
<li>2 cans (28 oz each) plum (Roma) tomatoes, drained and cut into 1/2 inch dice</li>
<li>3 cups (24 fl oz) chicken broth</li>
<li>2/3 cup (5 fl oz) dry white wine</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 lb Chilean Sea Bass, halibut, or other firm-fleshed whitefish filet, skinned and cut into 1-1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
<li>3/4lb sea scallops</li>
<li>3/4lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
<li>2 tablespoons julienned fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>6 orange wedges, each ½ inch thick</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>In a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. When hot, add the onions and carrots and sauté, stirring  occasionally, until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, broth, wine, basil, orange zest, red pepper flakes, and salt. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and cook, uncovered, for about 10 minutes to blend the flavors.
Add the fish cubes and simmer for about 3 minutes. Add the scallops and shrimp and continue to simmer until the fish and scallops are opaque throughout and the shrimp are curled and pink, 2-3 minutes longer. Taste and adjust the seasonings.
Ladle into warmed shallow soup bowls. Sprinkle each serving with about 1 teaspoon julienned basil and place an orange wedge alongside. Each diner should squeeze the juice from the orange wedge into stew before eating.
